Discourse + Auth0
========

This is a [discourse](https://discourse.org) plugin to do Single Sign On using [Auth0](https://www.auth0.com).

### Demo: https://ask.auth0.com

## What do I get by using Auth0?

* Support for Active Directory / LDAP (see [animated gif](#adding-active-directory--ldap))
  * No matter if Discourse is on the cloud or on-prem, it will work transparently
  * Support for Kerberos too (configured by IP ranges)
* Support for other enterprise logins like SAML Protocol, Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Salesforce, etc. All supported here: https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders.
* Support for social providers without having to add OmniAuth strategies by hand. Just turn on/off social providers (see [animated gif](#adding-social-providers))
* Support for Single Sign On with other Discourse instances and any other application in your account (see [animated gif](#single-sign-on-between-multiple-discourse-forums).

## Installation

-  Create an account on [Auth0](http://auth0.com) and register a new Rails application, __note: ignore the rails tutorial in Auth0__.

-  Run in your discourse root folder:

```
$ rake plugin:install repo=https://github.com/auth0/discourse-plugin name=auth0 
$ rake assets:precompile 
```

-  Login as an adminstrator to your discourse setting using one of the pre-existing auth plugins.

-  Configure the Auth0 plugin in the admin section

### Using Discourse Login Dialog instead of Auth0

You can keep using Discourse Login dialog and integrate only a specific connection from Auth0. It will show up as another button like the social providers.

Go to admin site settings for Auth0 and change the `auth0_connection` with the connection name you want to use from Auth0.

## TODO

* Add a plugin UI on the Admin section ot configure the secrets, etc.
* Add support for using Discourse Login user/password input to call Auth0 on AD/LDAP connections using [auth0.js](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.js)
